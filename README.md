**_This project is currently in development._**

### Friendly machine learning for the web!

ml5.js is a high level JavaScript library for machine learning. The main idea of this project is to further reduce the barriers between lower level machine learning and creative outputs using JavaScript.

It works by wrapping [TensorFlow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org/), providing a simple and friendly interface to work with GPU accelerated machine learning in JavaScript.

## Usage

Download the [full](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ml5js/ml5-library/master/dist/ml5.js), [minified](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ml5js/ml5-library/master/dist/ml5.min.js) or use the online version and add it to the head section of your HTML document:

```javascript
<script src="ml5.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```
or 
```javascript
<script src="https://unpkg.com/ml5" type="text/javascript"></script>
```
